# 30 Days or JS

## About

I believe in constant practice to master the art of programming and as such, I came across [Wes Bos' JavaScript30 course](https://javascript30.com/). 30 Days of pure HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript projects to practice and get better.

I wanted to make this repo to track my progress and share my lessons learned in each project.

Highly recommend Wes' course and you can find the github repo [here](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30). Hope you can gain some value out of my notes.
